Increasing number of vacationers are booking passage on cruise vessels. They feel secure from fire at sea as they are aware of the multitude of sprinkler heads protruding from the bulkheads, ready to quickly extinguish any spark or flame.

In actual fact, there is up to 90 kms of unprotected pipe connecting these sprinkler heads that can fail due to heat from fire. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has now mandated the “Casualty Threshold, Safe Return to Port” initiative and ship equipment manufac- turers are taking up the challenge to design systems that meet this regulation.

McAllister Mills has developed ALVEX-PF Passive Fire Protection for high pressure water mist systems, that meets the IMO Regulation mentioned above. ALVEX-PF is a totally inorganic, flexible, high tempera- ture insulation specifically designed to provide passive fire protection for marine applications.

ALVEX-PF meets A-60 fire test, and it is being tested as per IMO FTP. Res.A.754 (18), which enables the key fire protection system to main- tain operation for one hour minimum so that the vessel can reach port in the event of a fire.

In addition, ALVEX-PF can also be used on electrical conduits and junctions, communication cables, and other vital systems aboard ves- sels.

McAllister Mills has applied for Lloyd’s Certification Type Approval for ALVEX-PF, which will be issued in the very near future. Parallel to this, the U.S. Coast Guard will be including ALVEX-PF in their Type Approval . We will being actual sales of ALVEX-PF within the next few months and will keep you all apprised of our progress.
