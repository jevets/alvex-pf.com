After months of rigorous testing by independent laboratories, Alvex-PF has received Lloyd’s Register Certificate of Fire Approval for A-60 rating.

This certification means that Alvex-PF complies with the latest SOLAS Regulation II-2/21 & II-2/22 which mandates the SAFE RETURN TO PORT for all new passenger vessels.

With this certification, Alvex-PF is the only A-60 rated insulation material that is flexible, versatile, and rated to 1100 deg. C. In addition, Alvex-PF 38mm nominal thickness allows for installation in tight spaces on board vessels.
