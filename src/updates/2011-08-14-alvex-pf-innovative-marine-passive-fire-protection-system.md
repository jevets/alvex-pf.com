ALVEX PF Systems are designed to protect Fire Spray System Piping and Tubing per the latest SOLAS regulation II-2/21 and II-2/22. ALVEX PF is a totally inorganic, flexible, high-temperature insulation specifically designed to provide passive fire protection for marine applications. ALVEX PF chemistry is designed to enhance biosolubility as well as provide superior fire resistance. ALVEX PF provides high tensile strength, flexibility and superior thermal and acoustical properties. ALVEX PF is chemically stable and its thermal properties are unaffected after exposure to water immersion or high humidity. ALVEX PF is lightweight and easy to install.
